## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've been working on programming in C, so switching back to JS took a little longer than I expected, but I still managed to get it all done fairly quickly. üëç

### Continued development

Ideally, I'd like for the button that is clicked to maintain the colour change as feedback for the user to know that the button click worked... ü§î but I also don't want to spend too long on this because I have other homework to work on.
